        <p>In order to build the Sping ORM module for Castor JDO, you will have 
           the following requirements met on your system:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Download and install <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a></li>
                <li>Download and install a Subversion client</li>
                <li>Download and install <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>As this project uses Maven 2 for build and deployment, all required 
           compile-time dependencies will automatically be resolved by Maven 2
           and deployed into your local Maven 2 repository.</p>

        <p>July 5th, 2006: I have decided to make available a first release candidate
           of the Spring ORM implementation for Castor. Please note that in order 
           to be able to test this module, you'll <b>have to</b> download the
           following release candidate of Castor 1.0.2 as well</p>

    <section name="Deployment and use">

          <p>If you are not using Maven 2 to build the deployment unit
             of your application (within which you want to use the Spring ORM 
             module for Castor JDO and Castor JDO itself), below is a list 
             of run-time dependencies you will have to meet.</p>

    <section name="Building the Spring ORM module">
        
        <p>This section describes how to build the Spring module from a command 
           line using Maven 2. Whilst there is support for Maven 2 in various
           IDEs (including e.g. Eclipse, IDEA, etc.), using the Maven command 
           line seems to be the most adequate least common denominator.</p>
           
        <p><b>Note:</b> Please note that you will have to download several 
            JARs for SUN APIs like JTA and the Connector API yourself and 
            manually inject these JARs into your Maven 2 repository. For a more
            complete explanation of the problem, please check 
            <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-coping-with-sun-jars.html">here</a>.</p>
           
        <p>This section assumes that you have ckecked out the latest sources
           from the SVN repsitory for the Spring ORM module for Castor JDO.
           Instructions for doing so are provided <a href="source-repository.html">here</a>.</p>
           
        <p>Open a command line on your system, and issue the following commands:</p>
           
        <source>
 > mvn jar            
        </source>
        
        <p>Above command will compile the sources and create the distribution JAR
           in the <tt>target</tt> directory of the project root.</p>
           
        <p>To create the complete project documentation - in addition to
           the distribution assembly, please issue ...</p>
           
        <source>
 > mvn site            
        </source>
        
        <p>To install the newly created distribution JAR into your local Maven 2
           repository, please issue the following command:</p>
           
        <source>
 > mvn install            
        </source>
