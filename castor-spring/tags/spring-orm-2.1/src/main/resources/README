Spring ORM support for Castor JDO
=================================

Castor integrates Java objects, XML documents and SQL relational
databases in a unified model that allows information to be exchanged, 
persisted and manipulated in a variety of ways.

This project provides the user of Castor with Spring factory beans for Castor JDO
that fully implement the Spring ORM package, incl. factory beans for JDOManager, a 
CastorTemplate, etc.
