# Defines the (default) XML serializer factory to use by Castor, which must
# implement org.exolab.castor.xml.SerializerFactory; default is 
# org.exolab.castor.xml.XercesXMLSerializerFactory
# 
# When using Castor XML with JDK 5.0, you may switch to the XercesJDK5XMLSerializerFactory
# which will use the Xerces instance as shipped with the JDK itself; this avoids
# having to download another Xerces instance and installing it.
