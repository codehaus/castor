Spring factory beans for CASTOR XML
===================================

Castor integrates Java objects, XML documents and SQL relational
databases in a unified model that allows information to be exchanged, 
persisted and manipulated in a variety of ways.

This project provides the user of Castor with Spring factory beans for Castor XML 
components such as the (Un)Marshaller and obtaining a shared ClassDescriptorResolver 
instance, and  wiring them together.
