        <section>
            <section title="How do I set the encoding?">
            <p>
               Create a new instance of the Marshaller class and use the
               setEncoding method. You'll also need to make sure the
               encoding for the Writer is set properly as well:
               <code>
                  ...
                  String encoding = "ISO-8859-1";
                  FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("result.xml");
                  OutputStreamWriter osw = new OuputStreamWriter(fos, encoding);
                  Marshaller marshaller = new Marshaller(osw);
                  marshaller.setEncoding(encoding);
                  ...
               </code>
            </p>
            </section>
            <section title="Why is my 'get' method called twice?">
            <p>
               The get method will be called a second time during the
               validation process. To prevent this from happening
               simply disable validation on the Marshaller or Unmarshaller.

            <section title="Can private methods be introspected?">
            <p>
               Castor does not currently support introspection of private
               methods. Please make sure proper public accesssor methods
               are available for all fields that you wish to be handled
               by the Marshalling Framework.

            <section title="My mapping file seems to have no effect!">
            <p>
               Make sure you are not using one of the <i>static</i> methods
               on the Marshaller/Unmarshaller. Any configuration changes
               that you make to the Marshaller or Unmarshaller are not
               available from the static methods.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section title="Are there any tools to automatically create a mapping file?">
            <p>
               Yes! We provide one such tool, see org.exolab.castor.tools.MappingTool.
               There are some <a href="extras.xml">3rd party</a> tools as well.

        <section>
            <section title="Can I use a DTD with the source generator?">
            <p>
                  Not directly, however you can convert your DTD to an XML Schema
                  fairly easily. We provide a tool (org.exolab.castor.xml.dtd.Converter)
                  to do this. You can also use any number of 3rd-party tools such as
                  XML Spy or XML Authority.

            <section title="My XML output looks incorrect, what could be wrong?">
            <p>Also: I used the source code generator, but all my xml element names are getting
               marshalled as lowercase with hyphens, what's up with that?
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Solution:</b><br/>
               Are the generated class descriptors compiled? Make sure they
               get compiled along with the source code for the object model.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section title="The generated source code has incorrect or missing imports for imported schema types">
            <p>
               <b>Example:</b>
               <br/>
               Castor generates the following:
               <br/>
               <code>import types.Foo;</code>
                 instead of:
                <code>import com.acme.types.Foo;</code>
                This usually happens when the namespaces for the imported schemas have not been mapped
                to appropriate java packages in the <i>castorbuilder.properties</i> file.
            </p>
            <p>
               <ul><b>Solution:</b>
                  <li>
                      Make sure the castorbuilder.properties is in your classpath when you run the SourceGenerator.
                   </li>
                  <li>
                      Uncomment and edit the org.exolab.castor.builder.nspackages property.
                      Make sure to copy the value of the imported namespace exactly as it's referred to
                      in the schema (i.e. trailing slashes and case-sensitivity matter!).
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
               For those using 0.9.5.1, you'll need to upgrade due to the following bug:

            <section title="How can I make the generated source code more JDO friendly?">
            <p>For Castor 0.9.4 and above:</p>
            <p>
               Castor JDO requires a reference to the actual collection to be returned from
               the get-method. By default the source generator does not provide such a
               method. To enable such methods to be created, simple add the following
               line to your <i><b>castorbuilder.properties</b></i> file:
               <pre>
                   org.exolab.castor.builder.extraCollectionMethods=true
                </pre>
                Note: The default castorbuilder.properties file has this line commented out, simply
                uncomment it.
            </p>
            <p>Your mapping file will also need to be updated to include the proper set/get
               method names.
             </p>

                title="Is there a way to automatically create an XML Schema from an XML instance?">
            <p>
               Yes! We provide such a tool.
               Please see org.exolab.castor.xml.schema.util.XMLInstance2Schema.
               It's not 100% perfect, but it does a reasonable job.
