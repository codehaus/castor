Version 0.8  January 21, 2000
-----------------------------

Misc: ObjectDesc, FieldDesc and related classed have no been
      consolidated from the three modules and placed in a single
      package org.exolab.castor.desc.

Misc: FieldDesc adds required flag, readable/writeable flag, and
      target type. Some conversions are implemented between field type
      and target type.

Misc: Type conversion errors are now reported more accurately before,
      and a type conversion mechanism is being concieved.


Version 0.7.2  January 12, 2000
-------------------------------

JDO: Implemented object caching. Each transaction gets a single view
     of the object and may change that object without affecting the
     other transaction. Upon commit the shared view is updated. If the
     transaction is aborted, the object is returned to its original
     state.

JDO: Implemented two phase commit through the XAResource interface,
     allow Castor to perform a prepare stage followed by a separate
     commit stage. Improved the design of the checkpoint method.

JDO: Now implements the XAResource interface and can be used as
     an XA resource in a JTA/JTS transaction server.

Misc: Changed location of properties file to fix class name mismatch
      bug. Added example sources to the tar ball distribution.
      Rechecked the libraries to prevent build issues.


Version 0.7.1  January 11, 2000
-------------------------------

DAX: First release of some DAX code

JDO: Temporary fix to rollback of objects in lieu of missing
     CacheEngine (JDO)

JDO: Perliminary code for XAResource support in Castor JDO

XML: Added some support for derived archetypes (types) 
     - only extension derivation is possible at this time,
      so deriveBy must be "extension". 

XML: Added binary, and boolean types to the source code generator
     for Castor XML
     - binary types will be mapped to byte[] by default, and will
       be Base64 encoded and decoded automatically
     - boolean type is an enumeration of "true" or "false"

XML: Added support for byte[] -> encoding and decoding from Base64


Version 0.7  January 7, 2000
----------------------------

- First release of Castor JDO (Java Data Objects) supporting the
  ODMG API for object persistence over RDBMS.

- Changed MarshalDescriptor to better hide the reflection
  - uses #setValue, #getValue, instead of #getReadMethod, #getWriteMethod

- Changed the way validation is handled, added numerous
  validation related classes to org.exolab.castor.xml .

- Fixed bug with using primitives as PCDATA content of elements.

- Added timeInstant, NMToken and NCName types

=======


Version 0.6  December 20, 1999
------------------------------

- Marshaller package name changed to org.exolab.castor.xml
  (was org.exolab.xml.marshal).

- DSML implementation supporting JNDI and Mozilla Directory SDK.
  Importer/exporter sets for both directory APIs and XML-based
  search and import descriptors.

- Added configuration file support (castor.properties) specifying
  parser and serializer to use and default modes of operation.

- Change build environment to Ant.
