Version 0.7.8
-------------------------------

XML:    Added support for "annotation" as a child for most of the structures.
XML:    Added more support for "datatype"


Version 0.7.7  February 2, 2000
-------------------------------

XML:     Changed "archetype" to "type" in accordance with the 19991217
         XML Schema draft

XML:     Added support for "datatype"

XML:     Fixed a bug with the Base64 encoder which caused it to throw an
         ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception when it recieved a zero-length array

JDO:     Test for duplicate primary key only if select operation failed
         using either the SQL state (X/Open error code) or by running a
         separate select statement. (Contributed by Oleg Nitz)

Persist: Added scrolling capability to QueryResult and PersistenceQuery
         allowing more efficient collection implementation on top of JDBC
         drivers that support cursors. (Idea by Oleg Nitz)

Persist: Application level APIs now deal with PersistenceEngine and not
         with CacheEngine directly. All classes that extended CacheEngine
         have been eliminated.

Persist: Added an SPI package that defines interfaces for Castor
         service providers (i.e. persistence implementations).

Persist: Added support for XA transactions through an XAResouceImpl that
         manages transaction context creation and association. Interface
         initially used in DAX.

Misc:    New verion of Xerces (1.0.2+) and XSL:P included in this build.
         The Xerces update fixes several HTML printing problems, the XSL:P
         build included in this release is 4x faster.


Version 0.7.6  February 2, 2000
-------------------------------

DAX:  First appearance of the DAX implementation based on the Mozilla
      Directory SDK, using the persistence cache engine and the new
      mapping DTD.

Mapping: The mapping package has been upgraded to the new mapping DTD,
      and gained an XML sub-package that can be used to serialize
      mapping information. MappingResolver and MappingHelper are used
      to convert mapping files into descriptors.

Mapping: Added type strings (array of String) and big-integer
      (java.math.BigInteger).

Docs: Contents of readme file and changelog are now available from the
      HTML documentation.


Version 0.7.5  January 28, 2000
-------------------------------

JDO:  Finalized the transaction and locking semantics and started working
      on a document describing it. I would like to thank Chris Raber of
      GemStone for validating some of the design choices.

JDO:  SQLEngine now employs two schemes for detecting duplicate primary
      keys. For some databases it will use a separate SELECT statement,
      for those that properly return an SQL error it will use the X/Open
      error code (contributed by Oleg Nitz).

JDO:  Dirty check mechanism has been disabled since 0.7.4, although
      the new API enables any number of approaches. The dirty check
      mechanisms will be re-introduced in 0.7.6.

JDO:  Duplicate keys are now only detected inside a transaction, unless
      a similar object is locked by another transaction, fixing a
      potential problem in duplicate key reporting when object is
      removed from persistence storage directly.

Persist: Fixed deadlock detection algorithm. Previous algorithm would
      allow the second transaction to commit but rollback the first
      one. New algorithm allows first transaction to complete, but
      detects deadlock in second one and terminates it.

CMP:  No CMP engine yet, but the design architecture has been reviewed
      by RMH and supports the proper CMP semantics. Still need to
      determine how to deal with out-of-transaction methods. New
      architecture allows Castor to be used as CMP or BMP implementation.

Docs: Finally there. Added an Ant taskdef (style) and a task (doc) to
      produce documenation in build/doc and the doc JAR. Sources are
      XML, output is HTML, magic is XSLT.

Docs: Added document describing persistence architecture and started
      working on document describing transaction and locking semantics.

Misc: The examples have been broken to two packages: examples will contain
      brief and illustrative code showing how to develop with Castor,
      while tests will contain unit tests.


Version 0.7.4  January 23, 2000
-------------------------------

JDO:  New persistence engine. JDO package is now an ODMG API
      implementation on top of the concurrency engine and an SQL 92
      connector.

JDO:  New query mechanism allows multiple objects to be retrieved as
      an enumeration.

JDO:  Revised concurrency engine with query mechanism, object caching,
      transactions and locking, now resides in package
      org.exolab.castor.persist.

JDO:  Added SQL type conversion. A field mapping may now specify the
      SQL datatype using SQL names (numeric, varchar, etc). If the SQL
      type differs than the Java field type automatic conversion will
      apply. Convertors are provided for short/int/long, float/double,
      string, character/byte array, date and BigDecimal.

JDO:  Added dirty check attribute to field mapping. Fields that are
      marked for dirty check will be checked against the database to
      prevent concurrent updates. A concurrent update attempt will
      cause the transaction to rollback. When acquiring an exclusive
      lock at the beginning of the transaction no dirty checking
      occurs.

XML:  Added support for positive-integer and negative-integer
      (Source Generator)

XML:  Added support for Validation during Unmarshalling. Enabled by
      default.  (Marshalling Framework)

XML:  Changed Exceptions from SAXException and IOException to
      MarshalException and ValidationException (Framework + Source
      Generator) -- Sorry for the inconvenience.

Docs: This is the first release to see some documentation beyond the
      README file. The docs are located in the directory src/doc in XML
      and are transformed into HTML in the target directory build/doc.
      The transformation stylesheets are contained in src/doc/style.

Misc: Three layer persistence architecture introduced in this release.
      Each package implements the top level applications API (EJB,
      ODMG, DAX, JNDI), org.exolab.castor.persist implements the
      concurrency layer (transaction, locking, caching) and connectors
      are used to talk to the underlying persistent storage.

Misc: ObjectDesc, FieldDesc and related classed have no been
      consolidated from the three modules and placed in a single
      package org.exolab.castor.mapping.

Misc: FieldDesc adds required flag and readable/writeable flag.
      ObjectDesc adds key field (formerly JDO primary key) that is
      used across all the modules.

Misc: Type conversion errors are now reported more accurately before,
      and a type conversion mechanism is being concieved.


Version 0.7.2  January 12, 2000
-------------------------------

JDO: Implemented object caching. Each transaction gets a single view
     of the object and may change that object without affecting the
     other transaction. Upon commit the shared view is updated. If the
     transaction is aborted, the object is returned to its original
     state.

JDO: Implemented two phase commit through the XAResource interface,
     allow Castor to perform a prepare stage followed by a separate
     commit stage. Improved the design of the checkpoint method.

JDO: Now implements the XAResource interface and can be used as
     an XA resource in a JTA/JTS transaction server.

Misc: Changed location of properties file to fix class name mismatch
      bug. Added example sources to the tar ball distribution.
      Rechecked the libraries to prevent build issues.


Version 0.7.1  January 11, 2000
-------------------------------

DAX: First release of some DAX code

JDO: Temporary fix to rollback of objects in lieu of missing
     CacheEngine (JDO)

JDO: Perliminary code for XAResource support in Castor JDO

XML: Added some support for derived archetypes (types)
     - only extension derivation is possible at this time,
      so deriveBy must be "extension".

XML: Added binary, and boolean types to the source code generator
     for Castor XML
     - binary types will be mapped to byte[] by default, and will
       be Base64 encoded and decoded automatically
     - boolean type is an enumeration of "true" or "false"

XML: Added support for byte[] -> encoding and decoding from Base64


Version 0.7  January 7, 2000
----------------------------

- First release of Castor JDO (Java Data Objects) supporting the
  ODMG API for object persistence over RDBMS.

- Changed MarshalDescriptor to better hide the reflection
  - uses #setValue, #getValue, instead of #getReadMethod, #getWriteMethod

- Changed the way validation is handled, added numerous
  validation related classes to org.exolab.castor.xml .

- Fixed bug with using primitives as PCDATA content of elements.

- Added timeInstant, NMToken and NCName types

=======


Version 0.6  December 20, 1999
------------------------------

- Marshaller package name changed to org.exolab.castor.xml
  (was org.exolab.xml.marshal).

- DSML implementation supporting JNDI and Mozilla Directory SDK.
  Importer/exporter sets for both directory APIs and XML-based
  search and import descriptors.

- Added configuration file support (castor.properties) specifying
  parser and serializer to use and default modes of operation.

- Change build environment to Ant.
