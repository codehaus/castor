JDO: ObjectDesc/PrimaryKeyDesc are cloning return arrays to assure it
     is immutable and prevent the caller from changing their contents.
     This practice must be deprecated and checks made to assure these
     arrays are not altered, or use an immutable return collection.

JDO: Check that required fields are not null prior to storing object.

JDO: Use default values when creating a new empty object.

JDO: Properly deal with primary keys changed during transaction.

JDO: Check dirty only on dirty fields, only on objects that have dirty
     fields, and perform store only on objects that have actually
     changed.
