JDO: ObjectDesc/PrimaryKeyDesc are cloning return arrays to assure it
     is immutable and prevent the caller from changing their contents.
     This practice must be deprecated and checks made to assure these
     arrays are not altered, or use an immutable return collection.

JDO: Check that required fields are not null prior to storing object.

JDO: Required, read/write attributes are currently ignored.

JDO: Inheritence is not fully working.

JDO: Need to think up a better alternative to the ODMG API.

JDO: Add identityChange feature.
