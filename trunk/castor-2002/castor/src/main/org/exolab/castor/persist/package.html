  <title>Castor Persistence Engine API</title>
  <body>
    <p>The persistence engine API is used by the application APIs (JDO, CMP, DAX) to implement
       caching, queries, transactions and concurrency, etc. This layer is shared by all persistence
       engine and exposes a unified interface for use as a persistence engine for EJB CMP.</p>

    <p>An application API will use a <a href="TransactionContext.html">TransactionContext</a>
       in order to perform operations. All operations against the persistence engine are
       transactional.</p>

    <p>If the application API supports enlistment as an XA resource, it will use
       <a href="XAResourceImpl.html">XAResourceImpl</a> and implement <a href="XAResourceSource.html">
       XAResourceSource</a> for automatic enlistment/delistment with a transaction context.</p>
