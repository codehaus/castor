/**
 * This interfaces provides the operations necessary to perform database transactions.
 * All access, creation, and modification of persistent objects and their fields
 * must be done within a transaction. Before performing any database operations,
 * a thread must explicitly create a transaction object or associate itself with
 * an existing transaction object (by calling <code>join</code>),
 * and that transaction must be open (through a call to <code>begin</code>).
 * All subsequent operations by the thread, including reads, writes, and lock
 * acquisitions, are done under the thread’s current transaction.
 * <p>
 * A thread may only operate on its current transaction. For example,
 * a <code>TransactionNotInProgressException</code> is thrown if a thread attempts
 * to begin, commit, checkpoint, or abort a transaction prior to joining itself
 * to that transaction.
 * <p>
 * A transaction is either <i>open</i> or <i>closed</i>. A transaction is open if a call
 * has been made to <code>begin</code>, but no call has been made to <code>commit</code> or
 * <code>abort</code>. Once <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code> is called,
 * the transaction is closed. The method <code>isOpen</code> can be called to
 * determine the state of the transaction.
 * <p>
 * Read locks are implicitly obtained on objects as they are accessed.
 * Write locks are implicitly obtained as objects are modified.
 * <code>Transaction</code> objects are transient, they cannot be stored in the database.
