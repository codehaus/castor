  <title>Class Mapping Descriptors</title>

  <body>
    <p>This package provides a common base for the class mapping descriptors and tools to
       generate mapping descriptors from a mapping file. The Java objects for the XML-based
       mapping file are contained in the sub-package <tt>xml</tt> and the DTD and XML schema
       originate in this package. The sub-package <tt>loader</tt> implements a mapping loader.</p>

    <p>{@link ClassDescriptor} is a mapping descriptor for a Java class, consisting of any
       number of fields. {@link FieldDescriptor} is a mapping descriptor for a Java field
       within that class. Access to the field value is granted through a {@link FieldHandler},
       obtained from the field descriptor.</p>

   <p>{@link MappingResolver} is an interface to a collection of class mapping that can provide
      the mapping descriptor for a particular Java class. A {@link MappingResolver} is constructed
      using a mapping loader, see the <tt>loader</tt> package.</p>
