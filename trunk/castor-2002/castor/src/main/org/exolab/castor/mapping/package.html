  <title>Class Mapping Descriptors</title>

  <body>
    <p>This package provides a common base for the class mapping descriptors and tools to
       generate mapping descriptors from a mapping file. The Java objects for the XML-based
       mapping file are contained in the sub-package <tt>xml</tt> and the DTD and XML schema
       originate in this package.</p>

    <p>{@link ClassDesc} is a mapping descriptor for a Java class,  consisting of any
       number of fields. {@link FieldDesc} is a mapping descriptor for a Java field within
       that class. {@link ContainerFieldDesc} describes a special type of field, one that
       contains additional fields that are mapped as part of the container class, not with a
       separate class mapping. Relations are described using a {@link RelationDesc}.</p>

   <p>{@link Types} provides generic type functionality, e.g. constructing new instances,
      getting the class from a type name, determining if a class is a simple object, immutable, etc.
      Conversion between different Java types is implemented through a series of convertors
      implementing the {@link TypeConvertor} interface and listed in {@link Types}.</p>

   <p>{@link MappingResolver} is an interface to a collection of class mapping that can provide
      the mapping descriptor ({@link ClassDesc}>) for a particular Java class. A {@link MappingResolver}
      is constructed using a mapping helper, with {@link MappingHelper} providing common functionality,
      and each engine using its own derived implementation.</p>
