  <title>Class Mapping Descriptors</title>

  <body>
    <p>This package provides a common base for the object mapping descriptors and tools to
       generate mapping descriptors from a mapping file. The Java objects for the XML-based
       mapping file are contained in the sub-package <tt>xml</tt>.</p>

    <p><tt>ClassDesc</tt> is a mapping descriptor for a Java class,  consisting of any
       number of fields. <tt>FieldDesc</tt> is a mapping descriptor for a Java field within
       that class. <tt>ContainerFieldDesc</tt> describes a special type of field, one that
       contains additional fields that are mapped as part of the container class, not with a
       separate class mapping. Each of the fields container in the contained class is described
       with <tt>ContainedFieldDesc</tt>.</p>

   <p><tt>Types</tt> provides generic type functionality, e.g. constructing new instances,
      getting the class from a type name, determining if a class is a simple object, immutable, etc.</p>

   <p><tt>MappingResolver</tt> is an interface to a collection of class mapping that can provide
      the mapping descriptor (<tt>ClassDesc</tt>) for a particular Java class. A <tt>MappingResolver</tt>
      is constructed using a mapping helper, with <tt>MappingHelper</tt> providing common functionality.</p>
