    <p>Castor is a versatile B2B connector (marketing pitch) which integrates Java[tm] objects,
       XML documents, SQL relational databases and LDAP directories in a unified model that allows
       information to be exchanged, persisted and manipulated in a variety of ways. The Castor moto
       is simplifying the exchange and persistence of information.</p>

      <li>Castor DSML: LDAP directory exchange through XML</li>
    </ul>
